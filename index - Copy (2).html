            <h1>About Pirate Dan</h1>
            <p>
              Captain Dan Robin Blevins Catalano AKA Pirate Dan, is a
              personality gifted with many viable traits and attributes that
              lend themselves strongly and uniquely to our adventure. Captain
              Dan does not have to “get into character” to assume his position
              as Captain in this enterprise. Dan is 50% Viking (Germanic and
              Scandinavian), 40% Italian, 10% Irish and 100% Pirate. Dan is
              loud, gruff and more often than not, proudly boastful in demeanor.
              His closest genetic relative is the Grizzly Bear and two
              independent research studies done on Ancestry.com have found
              Sasquatch swinging from several branches in Dan’s family tree and
              it appears that Edward Teach himself (Black Beard) might have keel
              hauled Dan’s lineage as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dan has been shot, stabbed, jailed (no felonies), was a past
              member of the Hell’s Angels (sadly he had to take leave of the
              group because of a slight indiscretion with one of the leader’s
              wives) and has been an active participant in over 500 fights (none
              of which he started) and as Dan will tell you himself, is “still
              the best looking man standing”. He is 52 years old, 6’3” tall,
              weighs about 200lbs (400lbs if you’re fighting him), has blue
              eyes, grey hair and still has all his teeth. He counts both
              criminals and high ranking political figures (may be one and the
              same) as well as movie and sports stars as friends, along with
              dishwashers, waitresses, doormen and janitors. You might find Dan
              relaxing ocean side with Mel Brooks, Warren Metcalfe or Juliette
              Lewis on one night and on the next find him in some darkened alley
              shooting dice with the staff from one of the local resorts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dan personally built our last Pirate Ship and has rebuilt other
              large sail/motor ships and yachts. Dan has also built a score of
              custom Harleys and Show Cars that many front page and center folds
              of magazines will attest. Dan can build, repair, maintain and
              "drive" most anything that sails, floats, rolls, skids including
              anything that has an engine. There is probably only one trade that
              Dan would be incapable of performing well and that would be as an
              Undercover Detective, because he is incapable of going unnoticed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simply put, Dan can out work, out build, out repair, out fight,
              out dance, out romance, out lie, out talk and generally outsmart
              most any peer present.

              sacked his life-long foe, the Spanish army, most often on the
              order of Queen Elizabeth I herself. One of his greatest
              achievements was sailing to North America where he claimed new
              land on the Pacific coast for Queen Elizabeth. This journey led
              him to become the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe.
            </p>
            <h4>Francois l’Olonnais (French, 1635 – 1668):</h4>
            <p>
              l’Olonnais worked on an American plantation as an indentured
              servant until he turned to piracy. Known for his vicious behavior,
              l’Olonnais was one of the most successful pirates on land. He
              raided and captured many towns as well as ships. He is said to
              have eaten a Spanish soldier’s heart during one of his attacks.
            </p>
            <h4>William Kidd (Scottish, 1645 – 1701):</h4>
            <p>
              Known as “Captain Kidd”, Kidd was originally commissioned as a
              privateer to rid the seas of pirates. He reluctantly turned to
              piracy after being elected pirate captain by his crew. After
              attacking an East India Company vessel, he was captured in Boston
              and sent to trial in England where he was executed. His buried
              treasure, hidden somewhere on Gardiners Island, has created a
              legend around this notorious pirate.
            </p>
            <h4>Henry Every “Long Ben” (English, 1653 – Unknown):</h4>
            <p>
              Every began his career in the British Royal Navy and became a
              pirate captain by mutiny. He was the richest pirate in the world
              after capturing two of the finest treasure ships in the Indian
              Ocean, filled with gold and jewels.
            </p>
            <h4>Sir Henry Morgan (Welsh, 1653 – 1688):</h4>
            <p>
              Morgan was the head of the Jamaican fleet and terrorized Spain’s
              Caribbean colonies in the late 1600s. Rumor has it, he pillaged
              more than 400 ships throughout his career with his greatest
              achievement being the capture of the very wealthy Panama City
              (included 30 ships and 1,200 men). After the raid of Panama City,
              he was arrested and brought back to England. Because battle
              resumed between England and Spain, King Charles II not only
              released Morgan but also knighted him for his efforts against
              Spain. He returned to Jamaica where he served as deputy governor.
              Upon retirement, he lived as a well- respected farmer until his
              death.
            </p>
            <h4>Cheung Po Tsai (Chinese, early 1800s – mid 1800s):</h4>
            <p>
              A fisherman’s son, Tsai was captured by a pirate by whom he was
              later adopted. He eventually became a pirate himself where he
              commanded an army of over 50,000 men and several hundred ships. He
              amassed great treasure along the Guangdong coastline which he hid
              in a small cave that is still named after him to this day. He was
              caught by the Chinese government with whom he struck a deal and
              became a captain in the Qing Imperial Navy. He was later appointed
              colonel and spent the remainder of his life aiding the Chinese
              government in capturing pirates.
            </p>
            <h4>Edward Teach “Blackbeard” (English, 1680 – 1718):</h4>
            <p>
              Known for his fearsome appearance, Teach was one of the best-known
              and widely-feared pirates of his time. At the height of his
              career, he had an army of 300 pirates and captured over forty
              merchant ships in the Caribbean. His battle technique used two
              swords with several knives and pistols at the ready, and without
              flinching, killed many prisoners. After his death, his legend was
              romanticized and became an inspiration for many pirate-themed
              works of fiction.
            </p>
            <h4>Bartholomew Roberts “Black Bart” (Welsh, 1682 – 1722):</h4>
            <p>
              Roberts was wildly admired by his crew for his adventurist
              courage, navigation skills, and bravado. He captured over 400
              ships during his reign, and died in a vigorous battle against a
              British vessel, stunning both his followers and the British Royal
              Navy.

            <h1>About Female Pirates</h1>
            <h3>Fierce Female Pirates:</h3>

            <p>
              When you think of a pirate, what’s the first thing that comes into
              mind? An angry bearded man with a hook for a hand, right? Ha!
              Well, you should know to never discount the ladies who roamed the
              high seas! In fact, there were many female pirates – fierce ones
              at that. Here are a few of the most well known swashbuckling
              ladies in history…
            </p>

            <h4>Ching Shih:</h4>
            <img src="img/Ching-Shih-female-pirate.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Shih is known as the most successful female pirate in history. A
              fascinating historical figure, she was beautiful and a former
              prostitute. After gaining equality to her husband, the pirate
              Cheng, she took over his operation upon his demise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ching Shih controlled more than 1,500 ships with 80,000 men and
              plundered ships along the coast of the South China Sea. The
              Chinese government offered her pirate amnesty in exchange for
              peace, which she later accepted. She spent the remainder of her
              life running a casino and brothel with her husband, who was also
              her adopted son.
            </p>
            <h4>Lady Elizabeth Killigrew:</h4>
            <img src="img/graceomalley.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Lady Killigrew and her affluent husband controlled shipping in all
              of Cornwall. They used their position of wealth and large estate
              (Arwenack House) to acquire and store stolen goods in their home.
            </p>
            <p>
              After her husband passed, she took complete control of managing
              their pirate crew. In 1582, a Spanish ship was docked across
              Arwenack House and Lady Killigrew ordered her pirates to raid the
              vessel. Immediately after the raid, she was arrested for reselling
              stolen goods and was sentenced to death and eventually received a
              pardon from Queen Elizabeth I.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legend has it that Lady Killigrew buried treasure in her gardens
              which could be there to this day!
            </p>

            <h4>Sayyida al-Hurra:</h4>
            <img src="img/al-Hurra-famous-pirate.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              In 1515, after the death of her husband, Sayyida al-Hurra became
              the governor of Tetouan and turned to piracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              She ruled the western Mediterranean Sea from 1515 – 1542,
              terrorizing the Portuguese and Spanish and played an important
              role in negotiations for both nations. In 1542, she was overthrown
              by her son-in-law and stripped of her property and riches. To this
              day, her final fate remains unknown.
            </p>

            <h4>Anne Bonny:</h4>
            <img src="img/anne-bonny-famous-pirates-768x432-1.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              After eloping with a poor sailor named James Bonny, Anne Bonny was
              disowned by her father. She dressed as a man and ran away with her
              new husband to seek opportunity in the Caribbean. The romance
              between Anne and James didn’t last long, and soon after they
              arrived in the Caribbean, Anne left her husband for the famous
              pirate, Calico Jack. Bonny and Jack lived together as husband and
              wife aboard Jack’s pirate ship until they were captured by the
              British government.
            </p>
            <h4>Mary Read:</h4>
            <img
              src="img/Mary-Read-famous-female-pirate-768x543-1.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Mary Read’s impressive resume dates back to her mid-teens when she
              escaped her impoverished life in England and joined the army,
              going by the alias Mark. She fought with the infantry and cavalry
              in Flanders, and while serving she met, fell in love, and married
              a fellow soldier who died shortly after they wed. Read then
              abandoned the army and found herself on a Dutch privateer ship
              sailing to the West Indies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the journey, the ship was captured by Calico Jack and thus
              began Mary’s life as a pirate and a member of Jack’s crew. Legend
              has it that Mary protected a new lover from death by challenging
              his enemy to a duel. She came armed with a sword, pistol, and won.
              Go girl!
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1720, Jack’s ship was captured by Jonathan Barnet. While the
              majority of Jack’s crew hid below the decks, Mary and her BFF Anne
              Bonny, stayed on deck and attempted to fight off their capturers.
              They were unsuccessful in their fight which ultimately led to the
              deaths of all the male members of Jack’s crew, including Calico
              Jack himself. Mary and Anne were both imprisoned in Jamaica, where
              Mary died of a fever.
